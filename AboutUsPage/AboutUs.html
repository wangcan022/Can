<p class="ri" style="font-size:19px; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; line-height: 160%; letter-spacing: 1px; margin-top: 30px;">As our rainfall patterns and climate change more often in recent years, water supplyÂ is potentially at high risk especially in areas that rely heavily on grazing and agriculture. By collecting water from rainfall, water tanks can save on your water bill, make you more self-reliant and also bring many environmental benefits.</p>
<p class="ri" style="font-size:19px;font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; line-height: 2; letter-spacing: 1px;">We, the-BIT-Squad, built this website to help Australian hobby farmers choose, maintain and perhaps build water tanks according to their needs.</p>
